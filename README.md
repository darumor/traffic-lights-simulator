# Traffic Lights Simulator - README

    https://github.com/darumor/traffic-lights-simulator

## General

The idea is to create a simulator and / or visualisation of crossing(s) with traffic lights and traffic.

Roads and crossings are defined by some ML or data structure. It should be possible to read real road data from NLS

Traffic is generated according to some parameters or (real or generated) data from past traffic.

Traffic through the crossings is controlled by the traffic ligths. Individual transports have entry points and exit points.

Traffic ligths are controlled by an engine that can be replaced or developed independently of the crossing itself.

The engine tries to maximize the throughput through the network and minimize the waiting time for individual cars (and pedestrians)

The engine may use some sensors to gain information about the traffic or it could just be a smart, timer based engine.

The goal is to find the ultimate traffic light engine, learn bunch of stuff and have fun while doing it.
